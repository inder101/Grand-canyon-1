            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet is crucial for overall health, growth, and development. A healthy diet helps prevent various chronic diseases and provides the body with essential nutrients that it needs for daily function. In this project, we aim to explore the nutritional needs of different age groups, from children to the elderly, and identify how well our families are meeting these requirements.</p>
            <p>It is important to recognize that each age group has different nutritional needs based on their growth, activity levels, and health status. This project will evaluate the dietary habits of family members and compare them with the recommended nutritional needs for their respective age groups.</p>

            <h2>Nutritional Needs for Different Age Groups</h2>

            <div class="age-group">
                <h3>Children (2-12 years)</h3>
                <p>Children in this age group need a balanced diet that supports their rapid physical and cognitive development. They require essential nutrients like protein, calcium, iron, vitamins, and minerals to grow strong bones, muscles, and teeth.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Nutrients:</strong> Protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, fiber.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples of Foods:</strong> Milk, fruits (like apples and bananas), vegetables (carrots, spinach), grains (rice, oats), nuts, and eggs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommended Caloric Intake:</strong> 1,000 to 2,000 calories per day depending on activity level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Important Tips:</strong> Ensure a variety of food groups to help children develop healthy eating habits early on.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="age-group">
                <h3>Teenagers (13-19 years)</h3>
                <p>Teenagers are undergoing rapid growth and development, requiring a higher intake of certain nutrients. Iron, protein, calcium, and zinc are essential for supporting their muscle development, bone strength, and immune system function.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Nutrients:</strong> Iron, protein, calcium, zinc, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples of Foods:</strong> Eggs, dairy (milk, yogurt), leafy greens (spinach, kale), nuts (almonds, walnuts), fruits (oranges, berries), lean meats (chicken, turkey).</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommended Caloric Intake:</strong> 2,000 to 2,400 calories per day for active teenagers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Important Tips:</strong> Encourage balanced meals with a focus on nutrient-dense foods to support the growing body.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="age-group">
                <h3>Adults (20-59 years)</h3>
                <p>Adults need a diet that helps maintain energy levels, support metabolism, and prevent chronic diseases. A well-balanced diet rich in fiber, lean protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates is essential for overall health.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Nutrients:</strong> Fiber, protein, calcium, potassium, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin C, vitamin E.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples of Foods:</strong> Lean meats (chicken, fish), whole grains (brown rice, quinoa), fruits (apples, berries), vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers), legumes (beans, lentils), healthy fats (olive oil, avocado).</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommended Caloric Intake:</strong> 2,000 to 2,400 calories per day for adults.</li>
                    <li><strong>Important Tips:</strong> Aim for a variety of whole foods to support a balanced intake of all essential nutrients.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="age-group">
                <h3>Elderly (60+ years)</h3>
                <p>The elderly often experience changes in metabolism, bone density, and immune function. It is important for older adults to focus on nutrient-dense foods that support bone health, digestion, and overall immunity. Nutrients like calcium, fiber, vitamin D, and antioxidants are particularly important.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Nutrients:</strong> Calcium, vitamin D, fiber, antioxidants, protein, vitamin B12, potassium.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples of Foods:</strong> Low-fat dairy (milk, cheese), whole grains (oats, barley), soft fruits (bananas, berries), vegetables (carrots, sweet potatoes), nuts (almonds, cashews), fish (salmon, mackerel).</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommended Caloric Intake:</strong> 1,600 to 2,000 calories per day for elderly individuals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Important Tips:</strong> Focus on foods that support bone health and digestion. Fiber-rich foods are essential to maintain regularity.</li>

        <!-- Methodology Section -->
        <section id="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>To evaluate the nutritional needs of family members, we conducted a survey and recorded their daily diet over the course of three days. We compared the recorded diet to the recommended daily intake of nutrients for each age group, identifying any discrepancies or areas for improvement.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Survey family members about their daily eating habits and food choices.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Track the meals consumed over a period of three days, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Compare the recorded food intake with the recommended nutritional needs for their specific age group.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Identify areas where the diet may be lacking or exceeding in specific nutrients.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Findings Section -->
        <section id="findings">
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>After analyzing the collected data, we identified several areas where the family diet deviated from the recommended nutritional needs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Children's diet lacked sufficient iron and fiber.</li>
                <li>Teenagers consumed too much sugar and needed more calcium.</li>
                <li>Adults had a balanced diet but lacked sufficient omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
                <li>The elderly showed low levels of vitamin D and needed more fiber in their diet.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Suggestions Section -->
        <section id="suggestions">
            <h2>Suggestions and Improvements</h2>
            <p>Based on the findings, we have developed some simple and affordable suggestions to improve the diet of each family member:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Children:</strong> Include more leafy greens, legumes, and fruits high in iron and fiber like spinach and apples.</li>
                <li><strong>For Teenagers:</strong> Encourage a reduction in sugary snacks and increase calcium-rich foods like dairy products and leafy greens.</li>
                <li><strong>For Adults:</strong> Incorporate more omega-3 fatty acids by adding fish like salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds to their meals.</li>
                <li><strong>For the Elderly:</strong> Focus on foods rich in vitamin D (fortified dairy, sunlight exposure) and add high-fiber foods like oats and whole grains to their diet.</li>
            </ul>
